# AI-Powered Economic Activity Guide for the Visually Impaired

## Overview

This project aims to build a highly accessible website that guides visually impaired individuals on leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) for economic activities. The site will provide educational content, job opportunities, learning resources, and success stories in a format that is easy to navigate and consume with assistive technologies like screen readers.

## Design and Features

### Core Principles
- **Accessibility First (A11Y):** The entire site will be built to meet or exceed WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines). All elements will be screen-reader friendly and keyboard-navigable. ARIA attributes will be used extensively.
- **High-Contrast, Readable UI:** A default high-contrast color scheme will be used to ensure readability. Fonts will be large and clear.
- **Simplicity and Clarity:** The layout will be simple and logical, ensuring users can easily find information without getting lost.
- **Modern & Framework-less:** The project will use modern, standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without relying on external frameworks, ensuring performance and maintainability. Web Components will be used for reusable UI elements.

### Key Features
1.  **Accessible Navigation:** A clear, keyboard-navigable header with a "skip to main content" link.
2.  **Main Content Sections:**
    *   **Introduction to AI:** Explains what AI is and how it can be a powerful tool for the visually impaired.
    *   **AI-Powered Job Opportunities:** Details on jobs like data annotation, accessibility testing, content creation, and more.
    *   **Learning Resources:** A curated list of tutorials, online courses, and communities.
    *   **Success Stories:** Inspiring stories from visually impaired individuals who are successfully using AI in their careers.
3.  **Reusable Components:** Web Components will be created for elements like "resource cards" to present information in a structured and consistent way.
